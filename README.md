# Maze-Polymorphism-

# What It Does
This project contains a base maze class; the base maze class is made out of base cell classes. The maze is modifiyed through interfaces. There is interfaces mazeSolver and mazeGenerator; MazeSolver is implemented by mazeSolvers(First Depth Search) and MazeGenerator is impemented by MazeGenerators(Hunt and Kill). MazeGenerators create the maze, while MazeSolvers solve the Maze created by the MazeGenerators. 

Overall, it's about mazes.
